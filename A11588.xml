            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>The greater difficultie is, how th'Afflictions or tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Saints manifeſts the iuſt Iudgement to come: how followes th'Argument? Gods children are now afflicted: therefore there is a iuſt Iudgement to come.</p>

                  <p>Truth is, its one end why the Lord thus orders the ſtate of this world; thereby to nouriſh in vs perſwaſion of a Iudgement, hope and deſire of a life to come.

                  <p>Infuſed, wherein the vnderſtanding is eleuated aboue all its Naturals, and illuſtrated by ſo diuine power, that it giues credence to things aboue Reaſon, leaning onely on

How full of homonimy is euery peece of the argument. The end is there of the Temple and Citie, not of the world; if <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> or Saint <hi>Luke</hi> may bee credited, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.20. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt belike was to be before the deſtruction of Ieruſalem: indeed ſo you might better haue coloured your conceits of his Nation, and Temple; and remoued him farther from your Rome. 3.

                  <p>Infidelity is of two ſorts: 1 of pure Negation; ſuch in Pagans and Turkes to whom God neuer yet vouchſafed the word or meanes of faith. 2 of euill diſpoſition, <hi>when the price is put into the hands of fooles to get knowledge,</hi> but <hi>they haue no heart:</hi> the doctrine of faith vouchſafed, but credence denied vnto it. Such in children of the Church, whereof apertly this Scripture muſt be vnderſtood.</p>
                  <p>There are two kindes or degrees of it. 1 Totall reſpecting the whole word of God, all Articles of faith. 2 Partiall; where part of the Goſpell, ſome Articles of faith, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing belonging to euery Article is belieued; howbeit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſome points, or the ful ſentence of ſome one or more men are incredulous. Example. That faith in Chriſt was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſaluation, falſe Apoſtles amongſt <hi>Iewes</hi> denied not. But that it alone, or the obiect of it, Chriſts merit, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered our Iuſtification or made it perfit without workes of the Law, they belieued not, were therefore in part Infidels, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But is infidelity in any ſort chargeable on Papiſts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, they confeſſe to belieue the whole word of God in old and new Teſtament. The three Creeds they admit entire into their faith: how then may we charge infidelity on them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> Two things I commend to euery one deſirous herein to expedite himſelfe. 1 As in an oath impoſed, the forme is to ſpeak Truth, the whole truth, &amp; nothing but the truth. So in faith its required that Truth, whole truth, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth be belieued. If any thing but the truth be belieued, they are falſified in their faith; <hi>vt ſupra,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue a lye: If the whole Truth be not belieued, they are cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable ſo far of Infidelity. How Papiſts are falſified in their faith, ſo as they are chargeable with damned hereſie, we haue ſhown before: how they are Infidels notwithſtanding their profeſſed beliefe of all Articles of the Creed you may
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17318:90"/>thus conceiue: inaſmuch as they belieue not all Articles in their full ſenſe taken. Thus in a word. 1 The all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Chriſts meritorious paſſion they belieue not. 2 Nor his propriety incommunicable in his office of mediation. <hi>Exemp.</hi> That Chriſt ſuffered vnder <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was crucified, dead and buried, went downe to hell, Papiſts belieue: but did not, doe not Iewes ſo? who doubts but they belieue the generall hiſtory of Chriſts paſſion as it is articled in our Creed, recorded in the Goſpell; yet are Iewes Infidels in thoſe very Articles. Why? they belieue nor cauſe nor auaile of his paſſion; which is the life of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall truth couched in thoſe Articles: the cauſe,<note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 4.25.</note>

                  <p>Yet its true, both cauſe and auaile Papiſts in a ſort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that he died an Innocent, for the Nocent, to expiate our ſinnes; Where then is their Infidelity? that in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he intended expiation of all ſinnes <hi>mortall and veniall;</hi> diſcharged vs of <hi>all guilt,</hi> and obligation to <hi>all puniſhment</hi> temporall and eternall, they ſtiffely deny; our ſelues muſt ſatisfie for veniall ſinnes; procure diſcharge from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall puniſhments by our owne voluntary paſſions, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous good workes.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſt is mediatour of Interceſſion and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Papiſts belieue; herein are orthodoxe in faith: that he is the<note n="*" place="margin">1. Tim. 2.5. 1. Iohn 2.1, 2.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Next let be couſidered; the generall acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Scripture and all doctrines contained in Scripture to be of God, acquits not of particular Infidelity: for what if hereticall ſenſe be forced vpon the letter? and in that falſe ſenſe be belieued; there is a lye vnder that faith; there is infidelity, if to Scriptures in right ſenſe taken cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be denied. <hi>Exemp.</hi> That the Text in <hi>Iohn, Father, Word, and Spirit are</hi>

What now? When I finde direct, or conſequentiall repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and contradiction, twixt their pretended traditions, and writings? Muſt I thinke ſuch traditions Apoſtolicall?

Howbeit, the chiefe good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended as euill, may, vnder the fancied notion of euill, be hated; as the greateſt euill is loued, preſenting it ſelfe vnder the notion of good.</p>
                  <p>The greater queſtion is, whither nature afford not ſome loue of God, nature, I meane, fallen, vneleuated aboue it ſelfe, and vnaltered by grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> A queſtion harder then at firſt ſight it ſeemes, and which hath, as much as many, vexed Schoolemen. For my part, I eaſily ſide with them, which hold, that God is not, nor can bee loued aboue all, neither <hi>intenſiuè,</hi> nor <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatiuè,</hi> neither as Author of nature, nor as giuer of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall beatitude, without grace ſupernaturall.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is pregnant, becauſe ſuch meaſure of loue to God, endures no inordinate motion, or action againſt the Law of God. Which rectitude, if wee place in nature, wee fruſtrate grace, and directly contradict the Apoſtle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.</p>
                  <p>But whither there may not be in nature ſome motion, or affection of loue to God, a little other then concupiſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, is not ſo eaſily reſolued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bernard</hi> thus ſpecifies degrees of louing God by their ſeuerall motiues, or, as they terme them, formall reaſons. 1 When we loue God <hi>vt bonus ſit nobis,</hi> that hee may doe vs good; this loue is meerely concupiſcentiall, or as you may ſtile it, mercenary; the ſo louer intends his owne benefit only, and more loues himſelfe then God. 2 When wee loue God <hi>quia bonus fuit,</hi> becauſe hee hath done vs good, and heaped his benefits vpon vs, this iſſues from gratitude. 3 When we loue God <hi>quia bonus in ſe,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the amiable excellences which dwell in the Deitie.
